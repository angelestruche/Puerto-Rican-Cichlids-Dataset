# Dataset Card for Puerto Rican Cichlids Dataset

This dataset is a recollection of images of cichlid fish established across Puerto Rican reservoirs and streams. Its purpose is to document, identify, and collect allometric and morphometric data from various cichlid species of different sizes on the island. 
<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the dataset is or can be used for. --> 

## Dataset Details
This dataset includes species identification, location captured, and various body measurements. 

### Dataset Description

- **Curated by: Angel Sebastian Estruche Santos ()
- **Language(s) (NLP):** [More Information Needed]
<!-- Provide the basic links for the dataset. These will show up on the sidebar to the right of your dataset card ("Curated by" too). -->
- **Homepage:** 
- **Repository:** [related project repo]
- **Paper:** 


<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this dataset is. -->
[More Information Needed]

<!--This dataset card aims to be a base template for new datasets. It has been generated using [this raw template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/datasetcard_template.md?plain=1), and further altered to suit Imageomics Institute needs.-->


### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
[More Information Needed]

<!-- Provide benchmarking results -->


## Dataset Structure

<!-- This section provides a description of the dataset fields, and additional information about the dataset structure such as criteria used to create the splits, relationships between data points, etc. -->

<!-- Provide format of the dataset, ex:

```
/dataset/
    <species_1>/
        <img_id 1>.png
        <img_id 2>.png
        ...
        <img_id n>.png
    <species_2>/
        <img_id 1>.png
        <img_id 2>.png
        ...
        <img_id n>.png
    ...
    <species_N>/
        <img_id 1>.png
        <img_id 2>.png
        ...
        <img_id n>.png
    metadata.csv
```

-->

### Data Instances
[More Information Needed]

<!--
Describe data files

Ex: All images are named <img_id>.png, each within a folder named for the species. They are 1024 x 1024, and the color has been standardized using <link to color standardization package>.
-->

### Data Fields
[More Information Needed]
<!--
Describe the types of the data files or the columns in a CSV with metadata.

Ex: 
**metadata.csv**:
  - `img_id`: Unique identifier for the dataset. 
  - `specimen_id`: ID of specimen in the image, provided by museum data source. There are multiple images of a single specimen.
  - `species`: Species of the specimen in the image. There are N different species of <genus> of <animal>.
  - `view`: View of the specimen in the image (e.g., `ventral` or `dorsal` OR `top` or `bottom`, etc.; specify options where reasonable).
  - `file_name`: Relative path to image from the root of the directory (`<species>/<img_id>.png`); allows for image to be displayed in the dataset viewer alongside its associated metadata.
-->

### Data Splits
[More Information Needed]
<!--
Give your train-test splits for benchmarking; could be as simple as "split is indicated by the `split` column in the metadata file: `train`, `val`, or `test`." Or perhaps this is just the training dataset and other datasets were used for testing (you may indicate which were used).
-->

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale
[More Information Needed]
<!-- Motivation for the creation of this dataset. For instance, what you intended to study and why that required curation of a new dataset (or if it's newly collected data and why the data was collected (intended use)), etc. -->

### Source Data

<!-- This section describes the source data (e.g., news text and headlines, social media posts, translated sentences, ...). As well as an original source it was created from (e.g., sampling from Zenodo records, compiling images from different aggregators, etc.) -->

#### Data Collection and Processing
[More Information Needed]
<!-- This section describes the data collection and processing process such as data selection criteria, filtering and normalization methods, re-sizing of images, tools and libraries used, etc. 
This is what _you_ did to it following collection from the original source; it will be overall processing if you collected the data initially.
-->

#### Who are the source data producers?
[More Information Needed]
<!-- This section describes the people or systems who originally created the data.

Ex: This dataset is a collection of images taken of the butterfly collection housed at the Ohio State University Museum of Biological Diversity. The associated labels and metadata are the information provided with the collection from biologists that study butterflies and supplied the specimens to the museum.
 -->


### Annotations
<!-- 
If the dataset contains annotations which are not part of the initial data collection, use this section to describe them. 

Ex: We standardized the taxonomic labels provided by the various data sources to conform to a uniform 7-rank Linnean structure. (Then, under annotation process, describe how this was done: Our sources used different names for the same kingdom (both _Animalia_ and _Metazoa_), so we chose one for all (_Animalia_). -->

#### Annotation process
[More Information Needed]
<!-- This section describes the annotation process such as annotation tools used, the amount of data annotated, annotation guidelines provided to the annotators, interannotator statistics, annotation validation, etc. -->

#### Who are the annotators?
[More Information Needed]
<!-- This section describes the people or systems who created the annotations. -->

### Personal and Sensitive Information
[More Information Needed]
<!-- 
For instance, if your data includes people or endangered species. -->


## Considerations for Using the Data
[More Information Needed]
<!--
Things to consider while working with the dataset. For instance, maybe there are hybrids and they are labeled in the `hybrid_stat` column, so to get a subset without hybrids, subset to all instances in the metadata file such that `hybrid_stat` is _not_ "hybrid".
-->

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations
[More Information Needed]
<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. Could also address misuse, malicious use, and uses that the dataset will not work well for.-->

<!-- For instance, if your data exhibits a long-tailed distribution (and why). -->

### Recommendations
[More Information Needed]
<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

## Licensing Information
